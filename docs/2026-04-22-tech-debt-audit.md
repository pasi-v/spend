codebase_size: "~680 LOC, 6 modules"

## Overview

The `spend` codebase is a small personal CLI app (~680 lines across 6 Python modules) for tracking spending via an interactive SQLite-backed shell. The foundation is solid — parameterized queries, sensible module boundaries, stdlib-only — but there is zero test infrastructure, significant code duplication, and mixed concerns between I/O and domain logic. The overall picture is a project where refactoring is possible but currently risky because nothing is verified by tests.

Prioritization uses: **Priority = (Impact + Risk) × (6 − Effort)**, scores 1–5 each.

## Prioritized Debt Items

### ~~P1 — Zero Test Coverage~~ ✅ Done
**Category**: Test debt  
**Score**: (5 + 5) × (6 − 2) = **40**

There are no test files, no test framework, and no coverage reporting anywhere in the repo. All six modules (`db.py`, `shell.py`, `producers.py`, `products.py`, `stores.py`, `vouchers.py`) are completely untested. This makes any refactoring dangerous — there is no safety net to catch regressions.

*Fix*: Add `pytest` with a `pyproject.toml`, write unit tests for each domain module using an in-memory SQLite database (`":memory:"`). Target 60% coverage before touching anything else.

---

### P2 — Code Duplication Across CRUD Modules
**Category**: Code debt  
**Score**: (4 + 3) × (6 − 3) = **21**

The same structural patterns appear four times — once per entity (producer, product, store, voucher):

- `schema()` — table DDL template
- `select_*()` — query boilerplate
- `do_list_*()` — fetch + print loop
- `do_show_*()` — fetch-by-slug + print
- `do_delete_*()` — confirm + delete
- Slug normalization: `.lower()` called explicitly at every query site (16+ times across the four modules)

*Fix*: Extract a generic `BaseRepository` class or a set of helper functions (`list_entities`, `show_entity`, etc.). Normalize slugs in a single place (a `Slug` type or property). This is a medium-effort refactor but has a high payoff for maintainability.

---

### P3 — Mixed I/O and Domain Logic
**Category**: Architecture debt  
**Score**: (4 + 3) × (6 − 3) = **21**

`input()` calls are scattered throughout domain modules (`products.py:106`, `stores.py:67`, `producers.py:69`). The function `collect_voucher_lines()` in `shell.py` mixes stdin reading, string parsing, and a live database query (`require_product`) in one block. This is explicitly acknowledged in `TODO.md` line 9: *"Move all I/O from domain functions to shell.py"*.

*Fix*: Domain functions should accept plain values and return results. All `input()` calls belong in `shell.py`. This is the most architecturally meaningful refactor — it decouples the domain from the UI and enables testing.

---

### ~~P4 — Wildcard Import~~ ✅ Done
**Category**: Code debt  
**Score**: (3 + 3) × (6 − 1) = **30** (low effort, quick win)

`products.py:1` has `from producers import *`, which pulls in the entire `producers` namespace. This creates hidden dependencies, pollutes the module namespace, and will silently break if `producers` is ever renamed or restructured.

*Fix*: One line — replace with `from producers import require_producer` (or whichever symbol is actually used). Quick win.

---

### ~~P5 — Inadequate Error Handling~~ ✅ Done
**Category**: Code debt  
**Score**: (3 + 3) × (6 − 2) = **24**

`shell.py:237–248` catches only `sqlite3.IntegrityError` and re-raises everything else with a bare `raise`, losing context. Other DB errors (`OperationalError`, `ProgrammingError`) crash with an unformatted traceback. User-facing errors are plain `print()` statements with no log level, no timestamp, and no stack trace preservation. The debug prints flagged in `shell.py:31` (`# TODO: Remove these debug prints`) are still present.

*Fix*: Introduce `logging` in place of `print()` for errors. Expand exception handling to cover `sqlite3.OperationalError`. Remove or gate the debug prints behind a `--verbose` flag.

---

### ~~P6 — No Type Hints~~ ✅ Done
**Category**: Code debt  
**Score**: (3 + 2) × (6 − 2) = **20**

Type hints exist on roughly 2–3% of function signatures (18 instances across 6 files). The majority of functions — especially in `shell.py` and the CRUD modules — have no parameter or return type annotations. This limits IDE support and makes refactoring harder to validate.

*Fix*: Add type hints incrementally, starting with the domain modules (`producers.py`, `products.py`, etc.), then `shell.py`. Run `mypy` in strict mode once coverage is added. Low per-function effort, medium total effort.

---

### P7 — Hardcoded Values
**Category**: Code debt  
**Score**: (2 + 2) × (6 − 1) = **20**

The database filename `"spend.db"` is hardcoded in `main.py:6` and as a default parameter in `db.py:7`. The date format `"%Y-%m-%d"` is a string literal used in multiple places. Currency conversion (`* 100`, `/ 100`) is scattered across `vouchers.py` with no named constant or abstraction.

*Fix*: Define a `DATE_FORMAT` constant. Add a `Decimal`-to-cents helper. Accept the database path via a CLI argument or environment variable.

---

### P8 — No Schema Versioning / Migration Framework
**Category**: Architecture debt  
**Score**: (3 + 4) × (6 − 3) = **21**

There is no migration mechanism. Schema changes require manual SQL edits and will silently fail or corrupt existing databases. `TODO.md:5` flags this explicitly: *"Add schema versioning before next schema change"*. The presence of `spend.bak.db` suggests manual backup was used at some point before a schema change.

*Fix*: Add Alembic (or even a simple hand-rolled migration runner) before the next schema change. Alembic is a small addition for a stdlib-only project but a significant safety improvement.

---

### ~~P9 — Missing Project Metadata & Tooling~~ ✅ Done
**Category**: Infrastructure / Documentation debt  
**Score**: (2 + 2) × (6 − 1) = **20**

There is no `pyproject.toml`, `setup.py`, or `requirements.txt`. The Python version requirement is implicit (3.10+ due to match/case syntax). There is no pre-commit configuration, no linter setup (ruff, flake8), and no formatter config (black, ruff format).

*Fix*: Add a minimal `pyproject.toml` specifying `python = ">=3.10"`, dev dependencies (`pytest`, `mypy`, `ruff`), and a `[tool.ruff]` section. This is a single small file that unlocks the rest of the toolchain.

---

### P11 — Ruff Configured But Not Installed Or Used
**Category**: Infrastructure debt  
**Score**: (2 + 2) × (6 − 1) = **20**

`pyproject.toml` has a `[tool.ruff]` section selecting `E`, `F`, `I`, and `W` rules, but `ruff` is not in `dev-requirements.txt` and has never been run. The configuration is dormant; nothing surfaces unused imports, import ordering issues, or whitespace problems that ruff would catch. The original P9 fix added the config block but stopped short of actually installing or running the tool.

*Fix*: Add `ruff` to `dev-requirements.txt`, run `ruff check .` to surface issues, fix or auto-fix (`ruff check --fix .`) what it flags, then keep it as a routine check alongside mypy and pytest.

---

### P12 — No Continuous Integration
**Category**: Infrastructure debt  
**Score**: (4 + 3) × (6 − 2) = **28**

There is no CI pipeline (no `.github/workflows`, no other CI config). mypy strict mode, the 60% pytest coverage threshold, and (once P11 is fixed) ruff are all configured locally but nothing enforces them on push or pull request. Regressions in type safety, coverage, or lint can land silently if a contributor forgets to run the checks before pushing.

*Fix*: Add a GitHub Actions workflow that installs `dev-requirements.txt` and runs `ruff check .`, `mypy spend tests`, and `pytest`. Configure branch protection on `master` to require the workflow green before merge. Best done after P11 so all three checks are wired in from the start.

---

### ~~P10 — README and Documentation~~ ✅ Done
**Category**: Documentation debt  
**Score**: (2 + 1) × (6 − 1) = **15**

The README is two lines. There is no usage guide, no command reference, no schema documentation, and no ER diagram. The SQL examples in `queries/` are good but are not mentioned anywhere.

*Fix*: Expand README with: installation steps, available commands with examples, schema overview, and a pointer to the `queries/` folder. Low priority for a personal tool, but useful for future self.

---

## Phased Remediation Plan

This plan is designed to be done **alongside feature work** — no phase requires a freeze.

### ~~Phase 1 — Unblock Refactoring (1–2 sessions)~~ ✅ Done
Items: ~~P1~~, ~~P4~~, ~~P9~~

Add `pyproject.toml`, fix the wildcard import, write tests for the four domain modules using in-memory SQLite. This is the prerequisite for everything else — nothing else is safe to change until there is a test harness.

### Phase 2 — Clean Up Code Structure (2–3 sessions)
Items: ~~P5~~, ~~P6~~, P7

Fix error handling and remove debug prints. Add type hints to domain modules. Extract date format and currency constants. These are surgical changes, each independently safe once Phase 1 is done.

### Phase 3 — Enforcement & CI (1 session)
Items: P11, P12

Install and run ruff, fix what it flags, then add a GitHub Actions workflow that runs ruff, mypy, and pytest on every push and pull request. Order: P11 before P12 so the workflow can include ruff from the start. Done after Phase 2 (so all checks pass cleanly when CI first runs) and before Phase 4 (so the architectural refactors land under a safety net).

### Phase 4 — Architectural Improvements (3–4 sessions)
Items: P2, P3, P8

Extract CRUD patterns into shared helpers. Move `input()` calls out of domain modules. Add a migration runner before the next schema change. These are the most impactful changes for long-term maintainability — and the riskiest, which is why CI from Phase 3 should already be guarding them.

### Phase 5 — Polish (ongoing)
Items: ~~P10~~

Improve README, add readline auto-completion (from `TODO.md`), document schema with an ER diagram.
